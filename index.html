<p>The Rhodes Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL) is a Rhodes-internal action lab that works with senior scholars over several months on solving real-life data challenges they and their organization are facing. We are a technical and non-technical team of current Rhodes Scholars. Our technical team is composed of AI and machine learning engineers, statisticians, and computer scientists. Our non-technical team is composed of ex-consultants and domain specialists.</p>

<p>RAIL also hosts AI-related events around Rhodes House.</p>
