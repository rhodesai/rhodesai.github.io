      <h3>How long is a project cycle?</h3>
      <p>Typical project cycles last 2-3 months, with the next cycle starting in mid-January, lasting til late early April. However, in special cases it may be possible for a project to span two cycles.</p>

      <h3>How does RAIL handle data privacy?</h3>
      <p>RAIL prioritizes projects with open-source data, that can be handled without privacy issues. However, if you have an interesting project involving private data, we still want to work with you. A framework for ensuring data privacy will be individually discussed with each partner, specialised to the needs of the project. </p>

      <h3>Who owns the IP of a project?</h3>
      <p>The partner retains all ownership of their data, knowledge, and proprietary systems used to solve the problem. The partner also owns the deliverable. As a baseline, RAIL owns any other processes used to create the deliverable – which is most often the algorithm – and which can be licensed non-exclusively from RAIL. This is negotiable on a case-by-case basis.</p>

      <h3>Who will I be working with?</h3>
      <p>Each team of Rhodes Scholars consists of approximately 50% technical (e.g. DPhil/MSc students in AI, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics) and 50% non-technical consultants or domain experts. For example, a team working on a public health project may have an epidemiologist, a junior doctor, and a public policy student.</p>

      <h3>What is expected of me?</h3>
      <p>Our project partners are required to appoint one liaison (normally the Senior Scholar) who is expected to hold once-weekly Skype calls with the team, and respond promptly by email. In addition, you will work with RAIL before the project launch to scope the engagement and agree on terms.</p>

      <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
      <p>Our motivations are to improve our skills – both in Artificial Intelligence, and in problem-solving – while making an impact at the same time. We are particularly interested in supporting Senior Scholars do more good in the world.</p>

      <h3>How do I know working with RAIL is right for my organization?</h3>
      <p>If you are not sure we can help but believe there may be a way, please contact us. We are always happy to discuss potential partnerships. </p>

      <h3>How do I know if my data is mature enough?</h3>
      <p>We are seeking projects with matured datasets, so that machine learning techniques can effectively be applied to them. This means we put an emphasis on projects with data that is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean: with few missing values, formatted in an easily manipulatable way.
        <li>Large: ideally hundreds or thousands of observations, ML works best on big data.
        <li>Concise: Few erroneous variables lowers the chance of finding patterns that are non-persistent in application.
        <li>Repeatable: Has you data been collected in one go, or over many? Datasets with repetitive collection allow for stronger insight.
      </ol>

      <h3>What if the project cycle timeframes don’t suit my needs?</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in collaborating with RAIL, but the project does not match to our cycle timeframes, please contact us.</p>

      <h3>What form does a deliverable take?</h3>
      <p>The precise nature of a deliverable is worked out individually with each partner. This can anything from a detailed report, a slide deck, data visualisation, a presentation of key results. The partner can license non-exclusive use of proprietary algorithms or statistical processes from RAIL.</p>

      <h3>Do partnerships need to be exclusive?</h3>
      <p>RAIL does not require that projects be exclusively worked on by our organisation. </p>
