    <h3>We help your organization use the power of AI.</h3>
    <p>If your organization has data and a meaningful problem, you'll work
      hand-in-hand over two months with a talented team of current scholars.
      If you're doing something good in the world, we're driven to leverage
      powerful technology to support that. Along the way, you'll learn about
      this technology, and take back valuable insights.</p>

    <p>At the same time, you're investing in the development of the RAIL team.
      Your expertise and guidance, as well as challenging problem, is a
      direct investment into future leaders. We believe in the value of
      interdisciplinary leaders well-versed in technology and the
      technique of solving hard problems.</p>

    <h3>We work on certain types of problems.</h3>
    Specifically, three types of problems (in ranked order):
    <ol>
      <li><b>Technical Projects</b>: using and experimenting with
        frontier techniques in Artificial Intelligence.
      <li><b>Exploratory Projects</b>: exploring, analyzing, and visualizing
        your data to create new and meaningful insights.
      <li><b>Capacity-Building</b>: helping you understand how your organization
        can leverage AI.
    </ol>

    <p>Back in Oxford, the RAIL Team will be communicating with you and making
    progress each week: coding, graphing, interviewing, problem-solving.</p>

      be exposed to powerful insights in the process.</p>
