      <h3>We help your organization use the power of AI.</h3>
      <p>If your organization has data and a meaningful problem, you'll work
        hand-in-hand over two months with a talented team of current scholars.
        If you're doing something good in the world, we're driven to leverage
        powerful technology to support that. Along the way, you'll learn about
        this technology, and take back valuable insights.</p>

      <p>At the same time, you're investing in the development of the RAIL team.
        Your expertise and guidance, as well as challenging problem, is a
        direct investment into future leaders. We believe in the value of
        interdisciplinary leaders well-versed in technology and the
        technique of solving hard problems.</p>

      <h3>We work on certain types of problems.</h3>
      Specifically, three types of problems (in ranked order):
      <ol>
        <li><b>Technical Projects</b>: using and experimenting with
          frontier techniques in Artificial Intelligence to bring insight to a well-defined problem.
        <li><b>Exploratory Projects</b>: exploring, analyzing, and visualizing
          your data to create new and meaningful insights.
        <li><b>Capacity-Building</b>: helping you understand how your organization
          can leverage AI.
      </ol>

      <p>Back in Oxford, the RAIL Team will be communicating with you and making
      progress each week: coding, graphing, interviewing, problem-solving.</p>

      <p>Projects that inspire our work are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href = 'http://ai-d.org/research.html'>Predicting & modelling disease outbreaks using mobile phone data in Rwanda</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://www.frontierdevelopmentlab.org/#/'>Using AI to automatically prevent asteroid-earth collisions at NASA</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/tacomapublicschoolsstory">Predicting high school drop outs before they happen in Washington</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>You are key to the project's success.</h3>
      <p>We are serious about driving a valuable outcome for you. You are a
        critical piece of this process. At minimum, we expect a once-weekly Skype
        call, as well as back-and-forth emails. We sincerely believe that you'll
        be exposed to powerful insights in the process.</p>

      <h3 id='who-we-are'>We're a dedicated, selective team of talented individuals.</h3>
      <p>The result of a late night conversation (and years of work experience) between Brody Foy (Queensland & New College, 2015) and Logan Graham (British Columbia & Balliol, 2015), <b>RAIL's mission is to harness the power of AI to tackle meaningful challenges, while providing students a unique opportunity to develop their skills.</b></p>

      <p>The entire RAIL team is composed of current Rhodes Scholars, from all backgrounds. A sample of backgrounds include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DPhil/MSc in Computer Science, Engineering Science, Mathematics and Statistics</li>
        <li>Ex-McKinsey consultants</li>
        <li>Self-driving car & drone engineers</li>
        <li>Junior doctors</li>
        <li>Quantitative researchers</li>
        <li>MPP & MBA students</li>
        <li>Startup founders</li>
