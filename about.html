      <h3>We apply AI to important social challenges.</h3>
      <p> We work with your organization (company, university, non-profit, government)
        on using advanced technology to solve problems in a way that contributes to a
        better future on this earth. You'll work hand-in-hand with a
        group of extremely talented Rhodes Scholars over a fast-paced two months.
        We focus on <b>building things</b>: we create code, a presentation,
        a report, or whatever is needed to actually address the problem
        in the real world.</p>

      <p>At the same time, you're investing in the development of the RAIL team.
        Your expertise and guidance, as well as challenging problem, is a
        direct investment into future leaders. We believe in the value of
        interdisciplinary leaders well-versed in technology and the
        technique of solving hard problems.</p>

      <h3>Our work results in code you can use, academic publications, and scalable technology. </h3>
      <h3> You can read about our <a href="https://medium.com/@logangraham/rhodes-ai-lab-571a75fd36e"> first results here.</a></h3>

      <h3>In RAIL’s second cycle, we took on four diverse projects:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Predicting length of stay and recidivism in homeless shelters with the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/categories/social-services.page">NYC Dept of Social Services.</a></b>
        Nearly 60,000 New Yorkers reside in homeless shelters.
        Using information collected through surveys at intake, RAIL worked to predict how long homeless families would stay in shelter and which families would return to shelter.
        RAIL’s deep learning and penalized regression-based algorithms predicted whether a family would return to shelter with roughly 70% accuracy.
        With better information, New York City can more efficiently plan shelter capacity and more effectively deliver aftercare services to families who have moved to permanent housing.
        </li>

        <li><b>Predicting diabetes diagnosis with a developing country's largest health insurance scheme.</b>
        During RAIL’s first multi-term project, we used terabytes of data to predict whether or not millions of individuals would develop diabetes in the next 12 months.
        RAIL built a start-to-finish machine learning pipeline that incorporated sample rebalancing, feature engineering, and ensembling.
        RAIL also built custom deep neural networks and employed state-of-the-art prediction models.
        Results are expected in the next week.</li>

        <li><b>Predicting renewable energy market prices with an energy markets information group.</b>
        Renewable energy makes energy prices more uncertain in the short term; reducing the variation can help make renewables purchases more economical and more stable.
        RAIL built several multidimensional, time-series-based deep learning models that outperformed traditional models at 24-hour-ahead prediction.
        RAIL also delivered a survey of the landscape of state-of-the-art models and provided an implementation plan moving forward.
        </li>

        <li><b>Applying AI to antibiotic drug discovery with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a></b>.
        RAIL surveyed how machine learning could aid in the search through thousands of proteins and hundreds of thousands of drug targets for Tuberculosis.
        RAIL also built several proof-of-concept machine learning models.
        New drug discovery is one of PHE's critical tactics towards combatting antimicrobial resistance.</li>

      <h3>You are key to the project's success.</h3>
      <p>We are serious about driving a valuable outcome for you. You are a
        critical piece of this process. At minimum, we expect a once-weekly Skype
        call, as well as back-and-forth emails. We sincerely believe that you'll
        be exposed to powerful insights in the process.</p>

      <h3 id='who-we-are'>We're a dedicated, selective team of talented individuals.</h3>
      <p>The result of a late night conversation (and years of work experience) between Brody Foy (Queensland & New College, 2015) and Logan Graham (British Columbia & Balliol, 2015), <b>RAIL's mission is to harness the power of AI to tackle meaningful challenges, while providing students a unique opportunity to develop their skills.</b></p>

      <p>The entire RAIL team is composed of current Rhodes Scholars, from all backgrounds. A sample of backgrounds include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DPhil/MSc in Computer Science, Engineering Science, Mathematics and Statistics</li>
        <li>Ex-McKinsey consultants</li>
        <li>Self-driving car & drone engineers</li>
